Outside academia you need to do a lot of data cleaning and feature engineering, and if you’re constantly changing the model as well as the data you’ll never be able to attribute changes to either.
Chances are a DBA wouldn’t consider letting you do data engineering in a live production database anyway, so this really is all academic.
