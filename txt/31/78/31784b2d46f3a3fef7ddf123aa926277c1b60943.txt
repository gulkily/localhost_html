We canâ€™t control the extensions RDS allows to be installed, and they are historically conservative. Lev and I do have some fairly extensive experience with replication patterns to Postgres instances running in EC2. Foreign data wrappers are also an option, and depending on workload may be a good horizontal scaling strategy in addition.
